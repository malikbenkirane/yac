You will be given a commit message proposal that needs to be shortened while
still following commit message best practices.

Here is the commit message to shorten:

<commit_message>
{{COMMIT_MESSAGE}}
</commit_message>

Your task is to write a shorter version of this commit message that follows
these best practices:
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds
	feature")
- Keep the subject line concise (ideally 50 characters or less, maximum 72
	characters)
- Capitalize the first letter of the subject line
- Do not end the subject line with a period
- Focus on what the commit does and why, not how
- Preserve the most important information from the original message
- If the original has a body, you may condense or remove it if the subject line
	is sufficient

Before writing your shortened commit message, use the scratchpad to think
through: 1. What is the core action or change being made? 2. What are the most
essential details that must be preserved? 3. What can be removed or condensed
without losing critical information?

Write your shortened commit message inside <commit_message> tags. If a body is
needed, separate it from the subject line with a blank line.
