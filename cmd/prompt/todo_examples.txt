3. **`wip_context`** (optional): Work-in-progress notes, including:
   - Known issues or limitations in the current implementation
   - Planned improvements or refinements for future commits
   - Error messages encountered during development
   - Ideas for optimization or refactoring
   - Temporary workarounds that need proper solutions

### **3. Footer (Optional)**

Include a footer when relevant:

#### **Issue References:**
- `Fixes #123` - Use when PR/commit closes the issue
- `Closes #123, #456` - For multiple issues
- `Refs #123` - Related but doesn't close the issue
- `Part of #123` - Partial work on a larger issue
- `WIP for #123` - Work in progress toward resolving the issue

#### **Breaking Changes:**
If the change breaks backward compatibility, you **MUST**:
1. Add `!` before the colon in header: `feat(api)!: change auth endpoint`
2. Include footer section:
```
BREAKING CHANGE: The `/users` endpoint now requires authentication.
All clients must include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
Migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migration-v2
```

**Breaking Change Detection Heuristics:**
- Function/method signature changes (parameters added/removed/reordered)
- Removal of public methods, classes, or endpoints
- Changed default values affecting behavior
- Database migrations requiring manual intervention
- Configuration format changes

#### **WIP Indicators in Footer:**
When wip_context suggests significant incomplete work:
```
Known Issues:
- Authentication timeout still occurs under high load
- Edge case with empty user list needs handling
- Performance optimization pending for large datasets

Next Steps:
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Implement rate limiting
- Add integration tests for pagination edge cases
```

#### **Other Footer Types:**
```
Deprecates: `getUserById()` in favor of `users.findById()`
Removal planned for: v3.0.0

## **Using WIP Context**

When `wip_context` is provided, integrate it strategically:

### **1. Document Known Issues Transparently**
If wip_context mentions: "Error: timeout on large datasets, need to implement streaming"

Include in body:
```
Known limitation: Queries timeout for datasets >50k records.
Streaming implementation planned for next commit to handle
large result sets incrementally.
```

### **2. Acknowledge Temporary Solutions**
If wip_context notes: "Using setTimeout as temp fix, needs proper async handling"

Include in body:
```
Note: Currently uses setTimeout for async operation sequencing.
This is a temporary workaround; proper Promise-based flow
control will be implemented once the race condition in the
event emitter is resolved.
```

### **3. Document Future Improvements**
If wip_context lists improvements:
```
Future enhancements planned:
- Add Redis caching layer for frequently accessed pages
- Implement cursor-based pagination for better performance
- Add comprehensive input validation
```

### **4. Reference Error Messages**
If wip_context includes error messages:
```
Resolves the "Maximum call stack exceeded" error that occurred
when processing deeply nested user hierarchies. Previous
recursive approach replaced with iterative algorithm using
explicit stack.
```

### **5. Decide on `wip:` Type**
Use `wip:` type prefix ONLY when:
- The implementation is fundamentally incomplete
- Critical functionality is missing
- The commit is a checkpoint in a larger, unfinished feature

**Don't use `wip:` for:**
- Minor known issues or edge cases
- Planned future enhancements
- Technical debt that doesn't block functionality
