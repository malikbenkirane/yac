You will be converting a draft into a well-formatted GitHub issue for an
enhancement proposition. Here is the draft:

<draft>
{{DRAFT}}
</draft>

Your task is to create a GitHub issue that is concise and quick to read
(less than a minute). The issue should be structured as follows:

1. **TL;DR**: Start with a one-liner summary at the very top that
captures the essence of the enhancement request.

2. **Current Behavior**: Briefly describe how things work currently,
based on the information in the draft.

3. **Wanted Behavior**: Briefly describe the desired enhancement or
improvement, based on the information in the draft.

Keep the following guidelines in mind:
- Be concise and clear - the entire issue should be readable in under a
	minute
- Use simple, direct language
- Focus on the key points from the draft without unnecessary details
- This is an enhancement proposition, so frame it constructively
- Use appropriate formatting (like bold headers or bullet points) to
	improve readability

Write your GitHub issue inside <github_issue> tags.
