You will be creating a pull request description based on git commit logs. Here are the git logs you need to analyze:

<git_logs>
jj log -r main..@ -T builtin_log_detailed -G
</git_logs>

Your task is to write a clear, professional pull request description that summarizes the changes made in these commits.

Before writing your description, use the <scratchpad> section to:
1. List out all the commits and their main purposes
2. Identify the overall theme or primary goal of this pull request
3. Group related changes together
4. Note any important commit IDs that should be referenced

In your scratchpad analysis, pay careful attention to the format of commit IDs in the git logs. Each commit will have a line that says "Commit ID:" followed by the full commit hash. Extract only the commit ID (the hash value), not any "Change ID" that might also be present.

When writing your pull request description, follow these guidelines:

**Content Guidelines:**
- Focus on WHAT was changed and WHY it was changed, not the technical implementation details of HOW
- Identify the main purpose: is this a bug fix, new feature, refactoring, performance improvement, documentation update, or something else?
- Group related changes together logically
- Reference specific commit IDs when mentioning particular changes (use the format: "commit abc1234")
- Be concise and direct - avoid filler words and unnecessary elaboration
- Use a professional, technical tone appropriate for open source collaboration

**Format Guidelines:**
- Start with a brief summary sentence or two describing the overall purpose
- Use bullet points for listing multiple changes or improvements
- Use present tense (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep the description scannable and easy to read

**Example of good structure:**
```
This PR refactors the authentication module to improve maintainability and security.

Changes:
- Consolidate duplicate authentication logic (commit abc1234)
- Add input validation for user credentials (commit def5678)
- Update tests to cover edge cases (commit ghi9012)

This improves code maintainability and reduces the attack surface for authentication vulnerabilities.
```

After completing your analysis in the scratchpad, write your final pull request description inside <pr_description> tags.
